\page demos Demo Applications 

CrashRpt distribution contains several demo programs intended to show how CrashRpt 
intercepts critical errors and how it delivers error reports to software
vendor:
 - WTLDemo application demonstrates how CrashRpt works with WTL-based
   applications;
 - MFCDemo application demonstrates how CrashRpt works with MFC-based
   applications;
 - ConsoleDemo application demonstrates how CrashRpt works with console
   applications.

\section crashrpttest WTLDemo

\b WTLDemo application shows how CrashRpt intercepts exceptions in a WTL-based 
program and how it sends error reports to the software vendor. The application 
has simple dialog-based GUI that allows to choose what type of exception and in 
what thread to raise. 

To run WTLDemo, open \c bin directory and run \b WTLDemo.exe.
You can also compile the demo yourself.

WTLDemo application (see the figure below) is designed to test the most probable 
crash situations. 

The <i>Exception type</i> combo box allows to select an 
exception type. For more information about these exception types, refer to \ref exception_handling.

The <i>Thread</i> combo box allows to select the thread exception should be 
raised in. The <i>Capture Screen</i> button allows to capture end user's 
desktop and generate a video file that will be included to crash report.

The demo does not upload error reports to any server, it just demonstrates 
how error report delivery works.To make this demo to upload error reports to your
own server or to your E-mail address, you need to edit its configuration 
(see the <i>WTLDemo.cpp</i> file inside of <i>/demos/WTLDemo</i> 
folder) and then recompile the demo.

\section mfcdemo MFCDemo

\b MFCDemo application shows how CrashRpt intercepts exceptions in an MFC-based 
program and how it sends error reports to the software vendor. To run MFCDemo, 
open \c bin directory and run \b MFCDemo.exe. You can also compile the demo yourself.

MFCDemo application is shown in the figure below. To see what happens on crash, 
in the MFCDemo window, open menu File and choose Save. Then enter some file name 
and press the Save button. The application will terminate with an error message.

The MFCDemo application was created from scratch using the Visual Studio MFC 
wizard, and then it has been slightly modified to integrate it with CrashRpt. 
In <i>MFCDemo.cpp</i> file, <i>CMFCDemoApp::Run()</i> method was overridden, and
in <i>MFCDemoDoc.cpp</i>, the method <i>CMFCDemoDoc::Serialize()</i> was modified
to cause crash.

The MFCDemo does not upload error reports to any server, it just demonstrates 
how error report delivery works.To make this demo to upload error reports to your
own server or to your E-mail address, you need to edit its configuration 
(see the <i>MFCDemo.cpp</i> file inside of <i>/demos/MFCDemo</i> 
folder) and then recompile the demo.

\section crashcon ConsoleDemo 

\b ConsoleDemo application is a console application (presented in the figure below). 
It generates a SEH exception and shows how CrashRpt intercepts the exception and 
sends the error report to software support team.

To run the demo, open <i>bin</i> directory and run <i>ConsoleDemo.exe</i>.
You can also compile the demo yourself.

This demo does not upload error reports to any server, it just demonstrates how 
error report delivery works. To make this demo to upload your error reports, you 
need to edit its configuration (see <i>ConsoleDemo.cpp</i> file inside of 
<i>/demos/ConsoleDemo</i> folder) and then recompile the demo.
