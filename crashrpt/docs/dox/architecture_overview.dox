\page architecture_overview Architecture Overview

CrashRpt consists of two kinds of functionality: error reporting functionality 
and error report analyzis functionality. Error reporting functionality is distributed with
a client software and responsible for handling exceptions in the client software and 
deliverying error reports to the developer.

Error report analyzis functionality is designed to help the developer to extract data
contained in error reports and to simplify error report analyzis. It is usually located
at the side of the developer and not distributed with the client software.

\section error_reporting_functionality Error Reporting Functionality

Error reporting functionality consists of two core modules: \b CrashRpt.dll and \b CrashSender.exe.
- \b CrashRpt.dll contains functionality for handling exceptions in the client software.
- \b CrashSender.exe contains functionality for sending error reports to the software's support team.

\note Actually, CrashRpt files have version suffices, for example \b CrashRpt1400.dll, 
\b CrashSender1400.exe. In some places of the documentation we will omit these suffices 
for simplicity.

Two modules are needed to be able to close the application 
that crashes and to continue sending error report through \b CrashSender.exe 
in background.

Typically a process (executable file) loads \b CrashRpt.dll into its address space 
when process starts. This single instance of CrashRpt is shared between all DLL 
modules that are loaded into the process' address space. 

Client application uses \ref CrashRptAPI to set exception handlers in the process once, typically 
in its \b main() (or \b WinMain()) function. In a multi-threaded program, client additionally 
sets exception handlers in the beginning of the thread procedure of each worker thread.
For additional info, see \ref using_crashrpt_api.

\section error_report_analyzis_functionality Error Report Analyzis Functionality

Error report analyzis functionality consists of two modules:

- \b CrashRptProbe.dll implements API that can be used to access error report data.
- \b crprober.exe is a console tool that helps to extract error report data and
   write the summary in a human-readable form.

When you receive many error reports from users of your software, you 
would have to spend a lot of time to open each report, analyze its contents and
write some summary about the report. There may be many reports related to the same 
problem, so opening such reports doesn't tell anything new. The error report analyzis
functionality is designed to address these problems. For additional information, 
see \ref analyzing_error_reports.
