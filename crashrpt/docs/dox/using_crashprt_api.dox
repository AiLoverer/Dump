\page using_crashrpt_api Using CrashRpt API

CrashRpt library provides several API functions, structures and classes that can be used in your 
project (see \ref CrashRptAPI, \ref CrashRptStructs, \ref CrashRptWrappers). These are declared
in \ref CrashRpt.h header file.

\note Older versions of CrashRpt provided different set of API functions that are now 
declared obsolete. Those obsolete API functions are still supported for compatibility 
with older versions of CrashRpt, but may be removed in the future. 
It is recommended that you use the newer functions instead. 
Here is the complete list of \ref DeprecatedAPI.

\section common_conventions Common Naming Conventions

All CrashRpt functions have \c cr prefix, CrashRpt structures have \c CR prefix 
and CrashRpt classes have \c Cr prefix.

All CrashRpt functions using character set dependent arguments have two versions of function name 
(multibyte versions are A-suffixed and wide character versions are W-suffixed). For example, crInstall()
function has two versions of function name: crInstallA() and crInstallW(). Typically in your program you use a
character set independent mapping of function name, for example use crInstall() that 
expands into crInstallW() if you use wide character set or into crInstallA() if you use multibyte 
character set.
