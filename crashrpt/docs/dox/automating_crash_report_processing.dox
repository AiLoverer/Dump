The error report processing means opening a crash report, reading crash description 
XML, opening crash minidump file, retrieving important information about the 
exception, and finally presenting the information to the developer in text form.

Automating the error report processing becomes the critical task when you receive a 
lot of error reports after software release. Among hundreds of reports there may be 
only several different problems, while others just duplicate the information about 
those problems. Opening so many reports manually in Visual Studio or in WinDbg and 
analyzing their content may become boring and take a lot of time.

The easiest way to process error reports automatically is to install the 
CrashFix web application. CrashFix server allows to easily receive, store, 
organize and analyze crash reports sent by your C++ application. For additional information,
please see the \subpage crashfix_server page.

An alternative way is to use a command-line tool named <i>crprober.exe</i> provided  
by CrashRpt. The tool is designed for processing error report 
files and outputting the results to a text file or to terminal.
For additional information, please refer to the \subpage crprober_tool page.

The <i>crprober.exe</i> tool uses <i>CrashRptProbe API</i> internally. The API 
is designed to provide programming access to crash report file contents and
can be useful if you want to write your own crash report processing application.
For additional information, please refer to the \subpage using_crashrptprobe_api and
\subpage crashrptprobe_api_examples pages.
