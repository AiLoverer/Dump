# Maximum debug info cache size. CrashFix daemon caches

# The monitoring process is the process which monitors the 
# state of CrashFix daemon. The monitoring process 
# is usually launched automatically when the daemon starts 
# and killed when the daemon is terminated. The monitoring 
# process collects and logs sanity information about the 
# daemon, notifies the webmaster by E-mail on some undesired 
# events and restarts the daemon on crash.

# parameter equals to 1, otherwise it is not launched.
# Default: 1

# should restart the daemon when monitoring process detects
